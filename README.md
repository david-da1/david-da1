- 👋 Hi, I’m @david-da1 <- David D., Sr.
- - 👀 I’m interested in ... goofing around with 'puters, ever since my Sinclair ZX-81 and C-64 days, when those 6502 ml skills were "just" a hobby.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... linux, using Mint at the moment.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing, really .. too new to be forking up things already. Maybe later.
-    Today is 08/28/2023 @ 13:29 GMT .. looking forward to the journey.
